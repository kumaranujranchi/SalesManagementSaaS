# Production Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your Sales Management SaaS application for production use with a real database and proper authentication.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup (Neon PostgreSQL)

### Step 1: Create Neon Database

1. Go to [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your connection string (it looks like: `postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Update your `.env` file with the real database URL:

```env
# Replace with your actual Neon database URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-username:your-password@your-host.neon.tech/your-database
NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-username:your-password@your-host.neon.tech/your-database

# Generate a strong session secret
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-change-in-production-2025

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

### Step 3: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Install dependencies if not already done
npm install

# Run the database setup script
node setup-database.js
```

This will:
- Create all necessary tables
- Set up the demo organization and admin user
- Verify the database connection

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Build the Application

```bash
# Build the client and server
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

```bash
# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 3: Configure Netlify Environment Variables

In your Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
2. Add these variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your Neon database connection string
   - `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`: Same as DATABASE_URL
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: A strong random string

## üîê Login Credentials

After successful setup, you can login with:

**Demo Organization Admin:**
- Email: `admin@democompany.com`
